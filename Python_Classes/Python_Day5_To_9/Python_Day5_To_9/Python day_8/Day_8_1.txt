Errors :

1. Syntax erros : when not following principles of programming
2. Run time issues : exception
3. 

Catching Exceptions :

we cannot get two exception at a time. only one exception can error at ta time.

Generic excrptions:

1. try except block : is a generic block which is used for exception handling in python.
2. one try block can have multiple except blocks
3. try except block can be nested
4. A generic exceptions is catched by an exception class
5. One try block should be ended by either except block or finally block
6. we can also have an else block with try block, which will get executed when no exception raised by try block
7. We can also use sys module to get more information about exception, exception name, as well as reason for wxception


import sys.exec_info() - geives all information

Exception Name : sys.exec_info()[0]
Why I got exception : sys.exec_info[1]

globals() is afinction which contains all functions,identifiers,classes in python

try , else : else block will get executed only when try block has successfully executed

we can use try..except try..finally block,but try .. else is not accepted, only try would not be allowed,gives syntax error

3. Logical error : 

Debugging :

1. breakpoint : temporary suspension of code
2. Continue : 
3. Step In/Into : line by line execution, will go inside function
4. Step over : skip over function or module,
5. Step out : if ainside function then to come out of that function use step over
