Packages :

-> Collection of modules

First create a a package(allOperations), within this package create a __init__.py file, without or with any statement

Then add some modules inside that package. then import those packages or modules in whichever way u want to import them
according to ur own choice

__init__ : in this file we can initialise all modules which we want to import

if u want to import all modules from packages then it will not allow in pyhton, restriction

from allOperations import * - not import all modules,gives error

solution is : add this statement in __init__.py file

__all__ = ['arithmatic','arithmatic2']


from package import * - only import modules not packages : it only import __init__ added modules


>>> from allOperations.arithmatic2 import add
>>> add(20,30)


from allOperations import *
>>> arithmatic.add(10,20)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#15>", line 1, in <module>
    arithmatic.add(10,20)
NameError: name 'arithmatic' is not defined

In this case u need to define name of modules in __init__ files , __all__ = ['arithmatic']
