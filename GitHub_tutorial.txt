#Feature barnch
# Enhancement added for this repository

staging area : repo between local and remote one

** : git status command will give you following information:
- currently in which branch you are
- what are the changed/modified files


Whenever you have made changes to any file on your local repository(machine)
1. then you first need to move that file to staging area :
using command : git add filee_name (Move this file to staging area)
2. Commit that file using below command :
git commit -m "commit_message"
3. After commtting, move this file to remote repository

Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit

origin is something from where you are going to upload the file to remote repository
master is remote repository branch where you will be uploading all the files

if you donot have a remote origin then you can add origin local to whatever repo we are
uploading to or pushing to.

git remote add origin https://github.com/huy333/TestgitHub.git

Whenever you clone a repository then it automatically create a origin

if you have not cloned it then you have to add git remote add origin https://github.com/huy333/TestgitHub.git

4. Now to push file type below command :
-> git push -u origin master

Pull :

When you do git pull then, basically it pulls everything from remote repository to your local
repository

git log will show you the log of all commit history

git add command : add the file to staging area
git commit : sets the file toy local version control database
git push : push the code to GitHub

** git diftool shows difference between your local changes and previous version of the file

command : git diftool head

On github, owner can share his code with others
Other person can make code changes and send a request to owner to pull/merge his code changes into
owner's repository.

command :

git remote
origin

git remote -v
------------------
origin https://github.com/jaynath1992/Python_Automation.git(fetch)
origin https://github.com/jaynath1992/Python_Automation.git

origin is the default value for the repo which was cloned
********************************************************************

git fetch origin : will fetch all the changes since you made last cloned or fetch

Fetching will pull the data to your local repositories(will not merge the changes)

*******************************************************************************************
