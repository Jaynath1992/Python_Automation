Why do we need containerized infra ?
*********************************************

Current Approach (Test Controller Setup) :

-> Requires a CAG lab VM, treated as test controller machine, where all configuration and setup are done
-> All python/robot packages/plugins/tools to be installed before CIT execution
-> Test controller vm needs to be configured as static agent in jenkins

Concerns : 
*******************
-> Every time test controller to be configured for CIT execution when there is a new requirements such as OS upgrade
-> Dependency packages/Plugins should also be reinstalled on new VM.
-> Human error happens during setup readiness such as misplacing to configure some parameters, unsupported packages/version usage etc.
-> For the new engineer,Â  a tedious circumstance to bring up in the infrastructure to kick off the execution and time-consuming process

Containerized Approach :
*****************************
-> VM can be migrated as container which will be running inside k8s pod in DAAS environment
-> We will have docker image built with all the necessary packages/plugins/software/tools installed on this
-> Container will get spin off from docker image with all hardware (os, memory, storage) & software requirements
-> All the logs and html reports from container would be fetched and it would be available in Jenkins
-> Container and pods will get deleted at the end once test suite execution finishes
