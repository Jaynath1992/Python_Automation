User defined module :

pyc file : used for distribution purpose

if we modify anything in py file , then python does not create pyc file. it is old

so for that we need to restrat our sheel and again create a new pyc file.

compare py and pyc file : using timestamp, if py timestamp > pyc timestamp then reload

if pyc timestamp is less than py , then it creates a new pyc

import os
os.chdir('C:\Users\Jaynath\Dropbox\Ethans 13th May Batch\Day 7')

import Arithmatic

To get rid of this changing directory, directly define PYTHONPATH in user env varibale


inbuilt library :

Current location

PYTHONPATH : when u want to make ur python modul work from any directory then define PYTHONPATh env variables in sysstem and provide value of that path

Installation directory : C:\Python27

*******************************************

Standard Boiler Plate :

When a python program is run directly, the special variable __name__ is set to __main__

when we have to import module, then module name will be name of that module
