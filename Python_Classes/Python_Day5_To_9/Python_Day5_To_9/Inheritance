"""
=> inheritance is the ability to inherit properties and methods of existing class into a newer class.
=> So inheritance is process in which a child class inherits the properties and methods of a parent class.

Why Inheritance ?
-> Inheritance gives us the concept of re-usability
-> It removes code redundancy and duplication

Types of inheritance :

1. Single Level inheritance
2. Multi Level Inheritance
3. Multiple Inheritance
4. Hierarchical inheritance
5. Hybrid inheritance

"""

"""
Single Level Inheritance : Derived class inherits the properties and methods from a single parent class.

"""
# Example of single level inheritance in python below :
class Parent():

    def __init__(self):
        print('This is parent class constructor')
    
    def func1(self):
        print("This is parent class func1")

class Child(Parent):

    def __init__(self):
        print('This is child class constructor')

    def func2(self):
        print('This is child class func2')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    obj = Child()
    # Now using child object we can access both parent class and child class methods
    obj.func1()
    obj.func2()      


"""
Multi Level Inheritance : In this type of inheritance, a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class.

Multilevel Inheritance in Python is a type of Inheritance in which a class inherits from a class, which itself inherits from another class

class Parent(object):
