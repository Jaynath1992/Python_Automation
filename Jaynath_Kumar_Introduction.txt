"Hi, I’m Jaynath Kumar, and I bring 10 years of experience in software testing. 
My core expertise lies in automation—covering API testing, GUI automation using Selenium with Python, and backend automation through command-line interfaces. 
I’ve worked extensively with both Pytest and Robot Framework for test development. 
Additionally, I have hands-on experience with cloud-native technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform, which has helped me contribute to modern, scalable testing environments. 
I’m passionate about building efficient, reliable test systems and continuously improving quality processes."

So this is brief about myself, thank you.
