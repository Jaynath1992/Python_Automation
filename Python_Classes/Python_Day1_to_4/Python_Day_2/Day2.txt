execfile :

When we want to execute one python program from another python program then we can use this function

But this is available only in Python 2.7 not in Python 3.

In Pyhton 3 we have exec function

Core Objeects in Python :

Object : which have memory space

everyhting in python is a object of particular class

1. number :	int,float,long,complex


built in function : type(a) - to get the type of a class

length of integer in python  : 0 to 2**31 -1 = 2147483648L

Operators :

1. Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,**,//)	: When the operator have same precedence then left to right principle is followed

2. Bitwise Operator (&,|,^)

To convert decimal into binary :

int('1001',2) - 9

bin(10)	- '0b1010'	- it gives you first two character to represent 'ob' as binary

left shift : Right Shift

1011	11
1111	15
------&
1011	| 1111
		
 
11 XOR 15 = 
1011
1111
-----
0100


3. Comparision Operator : (>,>=,<,<=,==,!=,<.)

TypeCasting : is a principle in programming language which comes into existence when you are performing a operation between
two different objects . Numbers objects are compatible with each other so they perform implicit typecasting but this case is not
valid when you are using different objects

<> :	This operator is not available in python 3

20 <> 20.0 - False

Operator Overloading :

One operator can be held multiple functionality when they are performing operation on different different objects

Here is + is overloaded for string as well, so in case of number we are doing addition, in case of string they are doing
the concatenation.


len(string)-1 = gives last index of string , last character of string


in operaotr : membership operator

'i' in string

Slicing :

object[Start:End:Step]

object[::] - print whole string
object[1::1]



List : will hold multiple values at single time

what is immutable and mutable property of an object :

-> mutable objects are those objects in which we modify the element of an object.


String : immutable objects
List : mutable object


When we try to modify value of an element inside a list which is not present in the list, then it will raise exception(IndexError)
