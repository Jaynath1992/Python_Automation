Dictionary : holds key-value pairs

1. it holds unique key.. it can not have duplicate keys. if it has duplicate keys then it will keep latest values for that duplicate key
2. it holds elements in random order.unordered collection of objects
3. Arithmatic operation, operator overloadig..not possible
4. access value through key, viceversa is not true. 
5. Always use square brackets for indexing in list,dictionary as well
6. if i try to access a key which is not present in dictionary..then it will give keyerror exception
7. to remove element use , del employee['name'], it will delete that object, it is called destructor in oops

Deep copy :

Key of a dictionary should always be a immutable objects

employees = {[1,2,3]:[1,2,3]} 	-- Not possible but employees = {(1,2,3):[1,2,3]} - is Possible

Typerror : unhashable type : 'list'

********
Tuple
*********
Tuple : is exactly same as list but tuple is immutable object(we can not modify objects of tuple)

-> not appendable, not insertable, not removable

-> If Tuple having one element , always give comma(,) after that, if not given it will be treated as integer

If tuple contains objects which is mutable, then i can be able to modify the element.

list of tuple is - mutable
dictionary of tuple is - mutable

** if we have list inside tuple, then we can modify the items of that list, in this case tuple of list is mutable
** If we have tuple inside list, then we can not modify the items of that tuple, in this case list of tuples is immutable

Set : is an unordered collection of unique elements.

you can define it using Set keyword at beginning

accessing element using index is not supportable in set, because it is unordered collection of elements

set object does not support indexing : 

possible operations are : union, intersection, interjection




Conditional Statements :

if condition:
   statement 1
   statement 2
else:				(in else block you can use any spaces for indentation)
   Statement 3
   Statement 4
	



In Python 3, we don't have raw_input , only we have input function

raw_input and input both are pyhton2 in built functions, which prompts user and accepts string and number respectively

In pyhton 3, raw_input is not availbale, and it get replace by input function


Conditional statements:

Integer : 

0,0.0,0L,0j	- retutn false
string - empty string is false, even string is having space or tab or single spaces is true
list - empty list false
dict - empty dict false
tuple - empty tuple false
set - empty set false
Boolean false
None - None


if condition:
	
elif condition:

elif cindition:

else:


Loops :

while loop
for loop


while condition:
    Statement 1
    Stetment 2

it runs continuosly , until user provides intervention to it.

Ques: WAP to accept a input from user in form of number and print 10 odd numbers after that number.



While:

break
continue

while:


else:
	print 'will execute once while condition finishes it's execution but if we are using break statement then it will not got to else block'


break stement : will come out of the loop..if we are using break statement in a while loop , then it will come out of the loop without
executing the else bloack(if given)
