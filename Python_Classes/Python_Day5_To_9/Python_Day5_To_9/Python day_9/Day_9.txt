Object oriented python :

1. Sequential way of programming
2. Modular way of programming
3. Object oriented way of programming


class : is nothing but a prototype which contains two things one, class methods and and second attributes


object can access class methods and attributes


attribute : private and public

public are those which are use by objects

private are used by internal methods of classs


__add__ : private mathods

methods :


1. encapsulation : hising the complexity from user and only displaying interface to them
2.nheritance : they inherit or borrow the features from the class.

derived class, parent class

3. Polymorphism : many forms

overriding : 
overloading: same methods but different signatures : not available in python




oop is a methodology through which we can write a program in much effective way and utilizing the object oriented 
fundamentals like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

oop is highly useful in a project whic requires reusability functionality with each and every time.


an oop is met with modular programming, the whole code become mucg readable,scalable, and easy to use

a/c to ... oop they basically help you to reduce effort , time and beneficial for the big projects

Encapsulation :which says, hide the complexity from the user and only provide interface to them.

with the help of inheritance we can inherit it multiple classes and reduce the lines of code, with the powerful methodology

Polymorphism : provides multiple forms of an implementation using overriding and overloading principle


Construtor is a special function in oop language which creates an object
